# language-guesser

A Node.js script that takes a string argument passed in the CLI and attempts to guess which language it is. Only supports natural linguistic languages. If JavaScript is passed as an argument it will delete your system's root directory (I'm jk, not really).

#### How To Use:

In the CLI, while in the package's root directory, Run the command: `node index.js 'Language Sample'`
Where 'Language Sample' is a string contained within quotation marks.
